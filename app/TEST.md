## Clean Architecture

### Clean architecture layer

* __Presentation__: UI (Activity / Fragment), MVVM (ViewModel), DI, Service/ WorkManager, etc
* __Domain__: Use case, Model, Repository (Interface), make sure this layer dont have any Android Framework, it is pure Java or Kotlin
* __Data__: the user interface that user can interact with
### Clean architecture flow

## Architecture layers

To support this code architecture, we need to go further and break down the app into smaller modules. A module represent an isolated piece of logic that has one goal only.

_The current graph represent only partially the internal modules planned. It doesn't represent dependencies as a whole (Thrift or Statd missing for instance)_

### What are the benefits

Here is a list of some benefits of this new dependency architecture:

* Improve testability, reusability and maintainability by isolating logic from main app.
* Remove strong dependencies between layers (App -> Model, Pluto -> Model, Storage -> Model, etc.)
* Remove complexity in Main app: read more [here](./core-refactoring.md)
* Allow scalable project
* Avoid spaghetti code üçù 

### How does it works

The top layer is the closest to the user interaction. Navigating through the layers, we go deeper in the business logic, caring less about where the interaction comes from. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies are __unidirectional__, only from bottom to top. For instance, _Networking_ module can be used in _Feed_ or _Catalog_ but can't depend of _Wishlist_. 

At the same time, __modules can't depend of each other from same level__: _Feed_ can't depend of _Wishlist_, _Storage_ can't depend from _Networking_. However, using protocol oriented programming allows us to inject different dependencies through layers.

‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies are __optionals__: not every module should depend of previous layers: only _App_ implement _UI_ component, _Checkout_ might need only _Web Content_, etc.

Ideally, each layer should limit dependencies to next layer: the _App_ one shouldn't access any _Core_ or _Foundation_ one directly, but use _Flow_ one to abstract any computation logic, except for specific usage like UI (style guide).
